# Striketarget Live Trade Performance

## Overview

Real-time transparency into Striketarget's options trading performance during beta phase. Every trade will be executed with real capital using our proprietary Neural Decision Framework.

**Live Beta Launch:** September 1, 2025

**Note:** Initial beta will feature basic Neural Decision Framework consensus system with gradual enhancement of capabilities over time.

## Why This Matters

### The Institutional Problem

Academic research reveals systematic institutional trading failures:

- **Knight Capital (2012):** $460 million loss in 45 minutes from single algorithmic error
- **Flash Crash (2010):** $1 trillion market value erased in under 30 minutes
- **Anand et al. (2010):** Institutional trading costs increased 130% during market stress
- **Execution Risk:** Standard deviation surged 150% during crisis periods

### The Striketarget Approach

Our Neural Decision Framework is designed to address these systematic errors through:

1. **Algorithmic Error Detection** - Basic Neural Decision Framework consensus validation (Phase 1)
2. **Liquidity-Aware Execution** - Simple liquidity checks and order sizing (Phase 1)
3. **Risk Management Systems** - Basic risk assessment and position limits (Phase 1)
4. **Systemic Error Prevention** - Enhanced error detection and prevention (Phase 2+)

## Performance Metrics

### Primary Metrics (Institutional Focus)
- **Max Drawdown** - Maximum peak-to-trough decline
- **Sharpe Ratio** - Risk-adjusted returns
- **Sortino Ratio** - Downside risk-adjusted returns
- **Calmar Ratio** - Annual return / Max drawdown
- **Win Rate** - Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor** - Gross profit / Gross loss

### Secondary Metrics (Error Prevention)
- **Execution Cost Tracking** - Basic cost monitoring vs benchmarks
- **Risk Management Effectiveness** - Simple risk metrics and alerts
- **Error Prevention Systems** - Basic Neural Decision Framework consensus validation
- **Time to Recovery** - From drawdown to new highs
- **Neural Decision Framework Consensus Scores** - Agreement between Claude and Gemini (Phase 1)
- **Error Detection Accuracy** - Percentage of prevented errors (Phase 2+)

## Research Foundation

### Key Academic Papers

1. **Min & Borch (2022)** - "Systemic failures and organizational risk management in algorithmic trading"
   - Documents catastrophic institutional failures
   - Shows how single errors trigger cascading system failures

2. **Anand et al. (2010)** - "Market Crashes and Institutional Trading"
   - Quantifies institutional underperformance during stress
   - Shows 130% increase in trading costs during crisis

### Methodology

Our approach is designed to address documented institutional weaknesses:

- **Prevents Knight Capital Errors** - Basic Neural Decision Framework consensus validation designed to detect obvious errors
- **Avoids Flash Crash Scenarios** - Simple liquidity checks and order size limits
- **Reduces Execution Costs** - Basic risk management and position sizing
- **Manages Systemic Risk** - Enhanced capabilities planned for Phase 2+
